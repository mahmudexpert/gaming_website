                  Heroes of Lowhelm is a turn based RPG build within the Zilliqa blockchain. LOH
                  will challenge players to overcome amazing battles with stratagy whilst submerging
                  the users within a surreal environment.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The 2D aspect of HOL will create nostalgia within the community and will allow
                  users to relive their past gaming experiences like never before. With this in
                  mind, we have set out to deliver a 2D game that offers unparalleled levels of
                  animation quality to tap into that nostalgia.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The stories and quests within HOL will set this game apart from many other 2D
                  based games on the market, when including the power of the Zilliqa blockchain and
                  NFTs this sets HOL onto another level.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Early on, we have focused on how the events took place that left Lowhelm in dust,
                  engaging with the user and explaining the story as if they were there.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The events of the game unravel as the users grinds through missions and objections
                  to achieve the unlikely goal of defeating the invaders and regenerating their
                  past.

                <br />
                <p>
                  HOL uses the power of NFTs and the Zilliqa blockchain to reward users and engage
                  them along the epic story line. Users can unlock chests receive power ups and even
                  enhance weapons with so much more coming to this amazing 2D experience.
